## Description:
This program implements a **binary tree data structure** with a menu-driven interface. Users can insert integers into the tree, display the tree contents, and retrieve key properties such as leaf count, tree height, and width. The program ensures **input validation** for better user experience.

## Features:
- **Insert integers** into the binary tree.
- **Display the tree in order** using an in-order traversal.
- **Retrieve tree statistics**:
  - Count the number of leaf nodes.
  - Determine the height of the tree.
  - Calculate the width of the tree.
- **Robust Input Handling**:
  - Ensures only valid integers are entered.
  - Restricts menu choices to valid selections (1-6).

## Technologies Used:
- **C++** (Standard Library)
- `limits` for input validation
- Custom class **`BinaryTree`** (assumed to handle tree operations)

## How to Run:
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
